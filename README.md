# JS Hacking Basement

It's this one and only place in the web where I'm going to test some things based on JS injection techniques, like:

- changing functionalities on website via injecting JS scripts into websites
- styling/dynamic styling the elements based on DOM structure (or any provided one)
- testing some things related to loading injected content or its communication between server side

## Front-end
- HTML, CSS (SASS), JavaScript (+ jQuery to refresh jQ knowledge)
- Bootstrap v5

## Back-end
- Node.JS (v15) (Express.JS [+ CORS, BodyParser]) 
- `Database-like` JSON file with some content

## Builders etc.
- Parcel.JS

### How to use it?

Download the files anywhere that you want and:

```npm
npm install
```
